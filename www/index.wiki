<p>Fossil is a simple, high-reliability, distributed software configuration
management system with these advanced features:

  1.  <b>Integrated Bug Tracking, Wiki, Forum, and Technotes</b> -
      In addition to doing [./concepts.wiki | distributed version control]
      like Git and Mercurial,
      Fossil also supports [./bugtheory.wiki | bug tracking],
      [./wikitheory.wiki | wiki], [./forum.wiki | forum], and
      [./event.wiki | technotes].

  2.  <b>Built-in Web Interface</b> -
      Fossil has a built-in,
      [https://fossil-scm.org/skins/index.html | themeable],
      [./serverext.wiki | extensible],
      and intuitive [./webui.wiki | web interface]
      with a rich variety of information pages
      ([./webpage-ex.md|examples]) promoting situational awareness.
      <p>
      This entire website is just a running instance of Fossil.
      The pages you see here are all [./wikitheory.wiki | wiki] or
      [./embeddeddoc.wiki | embedded documentation] or (in the case of
      the [/uv/download.html|download] page)
      [./unvers.wiki | unversioned files].
      When you clone Fossil from one of its
      [./selfhost.wiki | self-hosting repositories],
      you get more than just source code - you get this entire website.

  3.  <b>Self-Contained</b> -
      Fossil is a single self-contained stand-alone executable.
      To install, simply download a
      [/uv/download.html | precompiled binary]
      for Linux, Mac, or Windows and put it on your $PATH.
      [./build.wiki | Easy-to-compile source code] is also available.

  4.  <b>Simple Networking</b> -
      No custom protocols or TCP ports.
      Fossil uses ordinary HTTP (or HTTPS or SSH)
      for network communications, so it works fine from behind
      restrictive firewalls, including [./quickstart.wiki#proxy|proxies].
      The protocol is
      [./stats.wiki | bandwidth efficient] to the point that Fossil can be
      used comfortably over dial-up or over the exceedingly slow Wifi on
      airliners.

  5.  <b>Simple Server Setup</b> -  No server is required, but if you want to
      set one up, Fossil supports [./server/ | several different server
      configurations] including CGI, SCGI, and direct HTTP.
      You can also easily set up your Fossil repository to automatically
      [./mirrortogithub.md | mirror content on GitHub].

  6.  <b>Autosync</b> -
      Fossil supports [./concepts.wiki#workflow | "autosync" mode]
      which helps to keep projects moving
      forward by reducing the amount of needless
      [./branching.wiki | forking and merging] often
      associated with distributed projects.

  7.  <b>Robust &amp; Reliable</b> -
      Fossil stores content using an [./fileformat.wiki | enduring file format]
      in an SQLite database so that transactions are
      atomic even if interrupted by a power loss or system crash.
      Automatic [./selfcheck.wiki | self-checks] verify that all aspects of
      the repository are consistent prior to each commit.

  8.  <b>Free and Open-Source</b> - Uses the [../COPYRIGHT-BSD2.txt|2-clause BSD license].
